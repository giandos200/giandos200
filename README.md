- 👋 Hi, I’m @giandos200
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- 👦 I’m currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Polytechnic of Bari and an ex-Research intern at IBM Research in Dublin, Ireland.
- :computer: On the 8th of January, I will join IBM Research in Dublin, Ireland, as a Research Scientist in the Security & Privacy team.
- 📚 I’m looking to collaborate on Trustworthy AI (Fairness, Explainability, and Counterfactual Reasoning) wherever would be the domain of application. I'm also working on Large Language Models (LLM) Security & Privacy. I'm also curious about Fairness in Recommender Systems and Deep Reinforcement Learning in Session-based Recommender Systems
